# CitySimulator
107 DSAP Final Project
For a Data Structure course, we are limited to not use any built in advanced data structure from the C++ library. We must create our own to fulfill our needs.

This project uses SFML as it's front end GUI library. As it makes strong use of the built in generics of the C++ library, our custom data structures must also fit the interfaces of the built in ones so that we may pass data to SFML.


This game is highly optimized to make it run smoothly on low end laptops from 2017. Game should maintain 30-60FPS even late game with large amounts of citizens.
